-Challenge 6-
Finally let's make some last little tweaks to make everything come together.
• Create a CSS selector that targets our "heading" id and change the font family to "Comic Sans MS".
• Create a CSS selector for our horizontal rule and set its width to 90% of its parent element and give it 20px of bottom margin.
• Let's make our dog descriptions a little easier to read. Create a CSS selector that targets our "textContainer" class and change the line height to 150%.
• Add 5px of border radius to all images.

- Then add onclick event of "changeImage()" function to the image tag

- When done, go to your Javascript and create the function - changeImage

- inside the changeImage function, set this url - (https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/684c9d087dab923db1ce4057903f03293b07deac/205_132_1915_1150/master/1915.jpg) as a variable named newImg

- also set the image tag as variable oldImg.

- then, let return newImg as the new src attribute of the image tag.

When you click on the image now, the image should change to the new image
